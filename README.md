The objective of this notebook is to explore the theoretical concepts and practical considerations related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By answering a series of
theoretical and conceptual questions, students will deepen their understanding of CNN architectures, training techniques, and applications in image processing tasks.
Guidelines:
1. Foundational Knowledge:
- Understand the theoretical concepts behind CNN architectures, including convolutional
layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Familiarize yourself with common activation functions used in CNNs and their impact on
network performance.
- Recognize the importance of regularization techniques such as dropout and batch
normalization in preventing overfitting.
